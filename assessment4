1.
find . -maxdepth 1 -size +2b
finds all files in working directory. '-maxdepth 1' does not look into directories
within the working directories, and stays at the top level. -size +2b adds a searching
parameter for files whose size exceeds 2 blocks (512 bytes/block standard).

2.
find ./ -regextype sed -regex ".*/[\^\*\\].*" -printf "%i\n"
finds all files in working directory that fit the given searching criteria. 
-regextype sed sets the type of regex used to create the searching criteria.
-regex  ".*/[\^\*\\].*" looks for files that begin with a '^', '*', or '\' 
and prints the inode number of each file that passes the criteria, with '%i'
followed by a new line character '\n'

3.
find / -printf "%i\n" | sort | uniq -d
find at root files with inode ("%i"). Sort these files and isolate files
that are duplicates (uniq -d).

Searches the current directory (.). Looks for NON (!) executable files (-executable)

5.
