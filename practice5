INSTRUCTIONS
============
1.   Compose an email to your instructor's Linux email account with the subject:
     CS 140U Practice 5 Submission

     The body of your email should contain your responses to the following tasks.
     There should be no attachment to this email - your answers should be in the
     message body.

     Label each response clearly so we know what task is being addressed.  After each
     response, explain how your command works, including each option used.

2.   Send the email when you have completed your responses.

3.   Here are the tasks for this assignment:

     (a)  Write a bash command that will display the value of all environment variables
          defined in your shell process, sorted in alphabetical order, and numbered.
          Here is a sample of the type of output your command should produce:

     1	}
     2	ALSA_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/alsa-pulse.conf
     3	AUDIODRIVER=pulseaudio
     4	BASH_FUNC_mc%%=() {  . /usr/share/mc/mc-wrapper.sh
     5	COLORTERM=1

     (b)  Write a bash command that will display the value (and only the value) of the
          JAVA_ROOT environment variable.   Here is a sample of the type of output your
          command should produce:

/usr/lib64/jvm/jre

     (c)  Write a bash command that will add your working directory and your home directory
          to the current value of the PATH variable.  Make sure your new PATH value works
          no matter what your current working directory might be.


     (d)  Write a bash command that will display the process ID number and the total CPU time
          for each process on the system.  Do not display any additional information. Here is a
          sample of the type of output your command should produce:

PID TIME
24648 00:00:00
25431 00:00:00
27567 00:00:00
27568 00:00:00
27569 00:00:00
27570 00:00:00

     (e)  Write a bash command that will display the name of every file on the Linux system
          whose file contaent contains the string "doug.jones".  The command must run in the
          background, must redirect standard error to /dev/null, and must redirect standard
          output to ~/out.

     (f)  Write a bash command that will kill all of the even-numbered processes associated 
          with your userid, and no other processes.

     (g)  Write a bash command that will start the program
          /home/courses/140u-doug.jones/zombie_maker
          as a background process, with standard output redirected to /dev/nulthat will kill all of the even-numbered processes associated 
          with your userid, and no other processes.

     (g)  Write a bash command that will start the program
          /home/courses/140u-doug.jones/zombie_maker
          as a background process, with standard output redirected to /dev/null.
          
          This program will create a zombie process.

     (h)  Write a bash command that will display the process id, parent process id, and wait
          channel for all zombie processes on the server.  Do not display any additional
          information.  Here is an example of the type of output your command should produce:
28318 28317 exit

     (i)  Write a bash command that will kill job 1.

     (j)  Write a bash command that will generate a file named
          ~/cpp_files
          that contains the name and absolute path of all files on the system
          that contain the line
          int main(int argc, char **argv)

          The contents of the file ~/cpp_files should be in alphabetical order.  The
          command you create should run in background, and redirect standard 
          error to the file ~/stderr.
