This repository contains all of my work from CS 140U - Intro to UNIX/Linux.

The folders are organized by week and contain the weekly assignments. Additionally, there are separate files that I have added to improve my interaction with the command line. At the time of this writing, these are my .vimrc and .mailrc files. 

Files will be added as my learning continues and my profile becomes more robust.
