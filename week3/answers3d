1.  :%s/^\(\w\+\)\(.*\s\)\(\w\+\)$/\3\2\1 Search every line throughout the document and replace the first and last words of each line. %s searches the entire document. ^ indicates to start at the beginning of each line. Each group is indicated by parenthesis which are escaped with backslash characters. The first group looks for a word character one or more times. The second group looks for any character 0 or more times followed by an empty space character. This second group categorizes every word and space between the first and last words. The last group identifies the last word which is indicated by a word character one or more times. This is followed by the character for the end of the line. The replacement is performed by reorganizing each group in the order: 3, 2, 1, which properly replaces the first and last word of the line without changing the remaining part of the line between these words.

2.  :%s/\(\,\s\)\(.\)/\1\u\2/g Search and replace the entire document for the pattern of a comma, followed by a space and assign both characters to group 1. Then, in the same line, search for the following character, and assign it to group 2. Replace group 1 and group 2 with group 1 followed by a capitalized group 2.

3.  :%s/\([A-Z]\)\([A-Z]\+\)/\U\1\L\2/g  Search for first characters of words that have remaining part of word in all caps. Sort these two identities into two groups and replace them by capitalizing the first group and setting the second group into lowercase. This regex command searches for a capitalized character and assigns it to group one. Then searches for remaining capital characters (one or more) and assigns them to group two. Then replaces the pattern with the order of a capitalized group one character followed with a series of lowercase group two characters.

4.  :%s/\n\n\n/\n\n   Search the entire document for three line break characters in sequence and replace them with two line break characters in sequence. 

5.  :%s/\(.\{,30}\)/\1\r  Search the entire document for patterns that match a series of up to 30 characters and group them together (group 1). Then replace that pattern with group one followed by a line break (\r).
